## Description
I wanted to expand my use of AngularJS with a full front-end application. After wire framing, I utilized Visual Studio to deliver and present my project. After local database seeding in my Angular Services, I used AngularJS to receive user input, filter and display personalized results. The Button selection sends information and changes states. After testing, and debugging, the application reliably maintains CRUD and functionality.
